## My GitHub User Search Application Learning Project README

### Welcome to My GitHub User Search Application Learning Project!

In this project, I will be developing a GitHub User Search Application using React. This hands-on project will guide me through integrating with the GitHub API, implementing user authentication, and deploying my application to a web hosting platform. By the end of this project, I aim to gain valuable experience in API interactions, advanced HTTP networking, and deploying web applications.

### My Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, my focus will be on achieving the following learning objectives:

1. **Setting Up a React Project for API Integration**:
   - I will create and configure a new React application to interact with external APIs, specifically the GitHub API.

2. **Developing Basic and Advanced Search Features Using GitHub API**:
   - I will implement basic search functionality to fetch and display GitHub user data.
   - I aim to enhance the search functionality to include advanced filtering criteria, such as location and repository count.

3. **Improving User Interface and Experience**:
   - I will utilize Tailwind CSS to style my application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

4. **Deploying the Application to a Web Hosting Platform**:
   - I plan to deploy my application to Vercel, making it publicly accessible and ensuring it performs well under real-world conditions.

### Getting Started

To begin this learning project using React, I will follow these steps:

1. set-up react using vite.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. I will begin implementing the project features based on the provided learning objectives.
